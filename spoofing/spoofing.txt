Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

Session Hijacking Vulnerability: In spoofing/insecure.js, the session cookie is set without the httpOnly and sameSite flags. This makes it susceptible to being accessed by client-side scripts, potentially leading to session hijacking where an attacker could steal the session cookie and impersonate the user.
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerability: The lack of sameSite flag in the session cookie in spoofing/insecure.js also makes it vulnerable to CSRF attacks. This is where an attacker tricks the user into making requests to the server without their knowledge, potentially leading to unauthorized actions being performed on their behalf.
Mitigation in Secure Version: In spoofing/secure.js, the session cookie is configured with httpOnly: true and sameSite: true flags. The httpOnly flag prevents the cookie from being accessed through client-side scripts, mitigating the risk of session hijacking. The sameSite flag ensures that the cookie is only sent with requests originating from the same domain as the target domain, which helps prevent CSRF attacks.
CIA Properties Violated by Spoofing: Spoofing primarily violates the Integrity and Authenticity aspects of the CIA triad. It allows an attacker to impersonate another user, thereby compromising the integrity of the user's identity and the authenticity of their actions within the system.
