Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability: In tampering/insecure.js, the server does not sanitize user input before rendering it back to the client. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts, such as <script> document.body.innerHTML = "<a href='https://google.com'> Gotcha </a>"</script>, which can be executed in the context of the user's session. This vulnerability can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, and spreading malware.
Mitigation in Secure Version: The secure version in tampering/secure.js prevents this kind of tampering attack by sanitizing user inputs. It uses a function (presumably escapeHTML) to encode special characters in the input before it is rendered back to the client. This prevents any injected scripts from being executed, as they are converted to harmless strings that are displayed as text rather than being executed as code.
CIA Property Violated by Tampering: Tampering primarily violates the Integrity property of the CIA triad. It allows an attacker to modify the content or behavior of the application in an unauthorized manner, thereby compromising the integrity of the application and the data it processes.
